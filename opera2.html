                have pity. In my book of etiquette the case of a maiden about to
                be wedded to one who unexpectedly turns out to be a baronet with
                a curse on him is not considered. Time was when you loved me
                madly. Prove that this was no selfish love by according your
                consent to my marriage with one who, if he be not you yourself,
                is the next best thing—your dearest friend!</p>
