    <h3>Ruddigore (W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan)</h3>
    <h4>Act-2</h4>
    <p>
        Scene.—Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle. The walls are
        covered with full-length portraits of the Baronets of
        Ruddigore from the time of James I.—the first being that of
        Sir Rupert, alluded to in the legend; the last, that of the
        last deceased Baronet, Sir Roderic.

        Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically. They are greatly altered
        in appearance, Robin wearing the haggard aspect of a guilty
        roue; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man.

        DUET—ROBIN and ADAM.

    <h4 class="chr_rob">ROB :</h4>
    <p>I once was as meek as a new-born lamb,
        I'm now Sir Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
        With greater precision</p>
    <p>(Without the elision),</p>
    <p>Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—ha! ha!</p>
    <h4> ADAM :</h4>
    <p> And I, who was once his valley-de-sham,
        As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
        The dickens may take him—
        I'll never forsake him!
        As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!</p>

    <h4>ADDITIONAL SONG </h4>

    <p>(Omitted after opening night.)</p>
    <h4>ROB :</h4>
    <p> My face is the index to my mind,
        All venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!
        Or, properly speaking,
        It soon will be reeking,
        With venom and spleen and gall—ha! ha!</p>
    <h4>ADAM:</h4>
    <p> My name from Adam Goodheart you'll find
        I've changed to Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!
        For bad Bart's steward
        Whose heart is much too hard
        Is always Gideon Crawle—ha! ha!</p>

    <h4>BOTH:</h4>
    <p> How dreadful when an innocent heart
        Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,
        And still more hard on old Adam,
        His former faithful valley-de-sham!</p>

    <h4>ROB: </h4>
    <p>This is a painful state of things, old Adam!</p>
    <h4>ADAM: </h4>
    <p> Painful, indeed! Ah, my poor master, when I swore
        that, come what would, I would serve you in all things for ever,
        I little thought to what a pass it would bring me! The
        confidential adviser to the greatest villain unhung! Now, sir,
        to business. What crime do you propose to commit to-day?</p>
    <h4>ROB:</h4>
    <p>How should I know? As my confidential adviser, it's
        your duty to suggest something.</p>
    <h4>ADAM:</h4>
    <p>Sir, I loathe the life you are leading, but a good
        old man's oath is paramount, and I obey. Richard Dauntless is
        here with pretty Rose Maybud, to ask your consent to their
        marriage. Poison their beer.</p>
    <h4>ROB:</h4>
    <p>No—not that—I know I'm a bad Bart., but I'm not as
        bad a Bart. as all that.</p>
    <h4>ADAM:</h4>
    <p>Well, there you are, you see! It's no use my making
        suggestions if you don't adopt them.</p>
    <h4>ROB</h4>
    <p>(melodramatically). How would it be, do you think,
        were I to lure him here with cunning wile—bind him with good
        stout rope to yonder post—and then, by making hideous faces at
        him, curdle the heart-blood in his arteries, and freeze the very
        marrow in his bones? How say you, Adam, is not the scheme well
        planned?</p>
    <h4>ADAM</h4>
    <p>It would be simply rude—nothing more. But
        soft—they come!</p>
    <p>(Adam and Robin retire up as Richard and Rose enter, preceded by
        Chorus of Bridesmaids.)</p>


    <h4>DUET—RICHARD and ROSE</h4>
    <h4>RICH</h4>
    <p> Happily coupled are we,
        You see—
        I am a jolly Jack Tar,
        My star,
        And you are the fairest,
        The richest and rarest
        Of innocent lasses you are,
        By far—
        Of innocent lasses you are!
        Fanned by a favouring gale,
        You'll sail
        Over life's treacherous sea
        With me,
        And as for bad weather,
        We'll brave it together,
        And you shall creep under my lee,
        My wee!
        And you shall creep under my lee!
        For you are such a smart little craft—
        Such a neat little, sweet little craft,
        Such a bright little, tight little,
        Slight little, light little,
        Trim little, prim little craft!</p>

    <h4>CHORUS</h4>
    <p> For she is such, etc.</p>

    <h4>ROSE</h4>
    <p> My hopes will be blighted, I fear,
        My dear;
        In a month you'll be going to sea,
        Quite free,
        And all of my wishes
        You'll throw to the fishes
        As though they were never to be;
        Poor me!
        As though they were never to be.
        And I shall be left all alone
        To moan,
        And weep at your cruel deceit,
        Complete;
        While you'll be asserting
        Your freedom by flirting
        With every woman you meet,
        You cheat—Ah!
        With every woman you meet! Ah!

        Though I am such a smart little craft—
        Such a neat little, sweet little craft,
        Such a bright little, tight little,
        Slight little, light little,
        Trim little, prim little craft!</p>

    <h4>CHORUS</h4>
    <p> Though she is such, etc.</p>
