                Scene.—Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle. The walls are
                covered with full-length portraits of the Baronets of
                Ruddigore from the time of James I.—the first being that of
                Sir Rupert, alluded to in the legend; the last, that of the
                last deceased Baronet, Sir Roderic.

                Enter Robin and Adam melodramatically. They are greatly altered
                in appearance, Robin wearing the haggard aspect of a guilty
                roue; Adam, that of the wicked steward to such a man.

                DUET—ROBIN and ADAM.

            <p class="chr-speech"> Painful, indeed! Ah, my poor master, when I swore
                that, come what would, I would serve you in all things for ever,
                I little thought to what a pass it would bring me! The
                confidential adviser to the greatest villain unhung! Now, sir,
                to business. What crime do you propose to commit to-day?</p>
            <h4 class="chr-rob"><span>ROB:</span> </h4>
            <p class="chr-speech">How should I know? As my confidential adviser, it's

            <h4 class="chr-adam"><span>ADAM:</span> </h4>
            <p class="chr-speech">Sir, I loathe the life you are leading, but a good
                old man's oath is paramount, and I obey. Richard Dauntless is
                here with pretty Rose Maybud, to ask your consent to their
                marriage. Poison their beer.</p>
            <h4 class="chr-rob"><span>ROB:</span> </h4>
            <p class="chr-speech">No—not that—I know I'm a bad Bart., but I'm not as
                bad a Bart. as all that.</p>

            <p class="chr-speech">Well, there you are, you see! It's no use my making

            <p class="chr-speech"> How would it be, do you think,
                were I to lure him here with cunning wile—bind him with good
                stout rope to yonder post—and then, by making hideous faces at
                him, curdle the heart-blood in his arteries, and freeze the very
                marrow in his bones? How say you, Adam, is not the scheme well
                planned?</p>
            <h4 class="chr-adam"><span>ADAM:</span> </h4>
            <p class="chr-speech">It would be simply rude—nothing more. But

                And you are the fairest,

                Fanned by a favouring gale,

                My wee!
                And you shall creep under my lee!
                For you are such a smart little craft—
                Such a neat little, sweet little craft,
                Such a bright little, tight little,

                And all of my wishes
                You'll throw to the fishes
                As though they were never to be;
                Poor me!
                As though they were never to be.
                And I shall be left all alone
                To moan,
                And weep at your cruel deceit,
                Complete;

                You cheat—Ah!
